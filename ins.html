            Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time by comparisons. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion
            sort provides several advantages:<br> Simple implementation: Jon Bentley shows a three-line C/C++ version that is five-lines when optimized.[1] Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) sorting
            algorithms More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic algorithms such as <br>selection sort or bubble sort Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(kn) when each
            element in the input is no more than k<br> places away from its sorted position Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space Online;
            i.e., can sort a list as it receives it When people manually sort cards in a bridge hand, most use a method that is similar to insertion sort.

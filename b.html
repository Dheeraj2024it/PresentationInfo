            Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rise up
            to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration. Although it is simple to use, it is primarily used as an educational tool because the performance of bubble sort is poor in the real world. It
            is not suitable for large data sets.<br> The average and worst-case complexity of Bubble sort is O(n2), <br>where n is a number of items. Bubble short is majorly used where - complexity does not matter simple and shortcode is preferred
            Algorithm In the algorithm given below, suppose arr is an array of n elements. The assumed swap function in the algorithm will swap the values of given array elements.<br> begin BubbleSort(arr) for all array elements if arr[i] > arr[i+1] swap(arr[i],
            arr[i+1]) <br>end if end for return arr end BubbleSort Working of Bubble sort Algorithm Now, let's see the working of Bubble sort Algorithm. To understand the working of bubble sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. We are taking a
            short and accurate array, as we know the <br>complexity of bubble sort is O(n2).
